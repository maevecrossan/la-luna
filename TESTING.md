| Issue | Details | Fix |
|-----|:-----:|:-----:|
| ![testing screenshot](docs/testing/date_field_not_working.png) | While creating the admin panel, the date input was not rendering properly for the admin. | ![testing screenshot](docs/testing/date_field_now_working_rearranged_and_imported_custom_form_to_admin.png) Register custom BookingAdmin model in admin.py |
| ![testing screenshot](docs/testing/form-fields-not-appearing.png) | Booking form fields not appearing. | ![testing screenshot](docs/testing/form-fields-appearing-1.png) ![testing screenshot](docs/testing/form-fields-appearing-2.png) Install cripsy forms and pass `form` into the bookingsystem views.py file. |
| ![testing screenshot](docs/testing/form-date-debug-1.png) ![testing screenshot](docs/testing/form-date-debug-2.png) | When preventing bookings in the past (date-wise), the date field stopped working completely. | ![testing screenshot](docs/testing/form-date-debug-3.png) Added `min="{{ today }}` |
| ![testing screenshot](docs/testing/no_id_for_form_inputs1.png) | ![testing screenshot](docs/testing/no_id_for_form_inputs2.png) ![testing screenshot](docs/testing/no_id_for_form_inputs3.png) Google dev tools raised 6 issues relating to my form fields not having ids. | ![testing screenshot](photo-link) Added ids to the `BookingForm` model |
| ![testing screenshot](docs/testing/form_not_posting_after_emailjs_bug_fixed1.png) | Email.js and POST method conflicting: At times, only one function was being executed. When email.js was working, it tripped up the POST request, and vice versa. | After several rounds of refactoring and debugging, updating the url, and the return statement in `booking-confirmation-email.js`. |
| ![testing screenshot](docs/testing/bookings_rendering_no_style.png) | Bookings previously only visible on backend now visible on front end but styling wasn't rendering and was very messy and unreadable. Validity was also incorrect. | Styling fixed to isolate bookings into a more appealing presentation. Validity just needed one simple tweak from <br>`return datetime.now() < end_datetime` to <br> `return datetime.now() > end_datetime` (line 150 bookingsystem/models.py) |
| ![testing screenshot](docs/testing/updated_runtime_file.png) | Issue deploying on Heroku. | I had forgotten to recollect my static files, so I did so which fixed the issue. During deploying, the logs stated I should update python for improved security. <br> I did so but had to rename my runtime.txt file to `.python-version` and merely state the numeric verion I wished to use. After removing the python prefix, the project successfully built and deployed.|
|  | One of my largest and reoccuring issues was to do with the `my-bookings` section appearing. The issue came to light when adding user authentication and filtering. The `my-bookings` page displayed the message for when there are no bookings, despite my database storing roughly 20 bookings at the time. In the end, the fix was relatively simple, but was tricky to initially find. | I originally allowed the user field (booking model) to have `blank` and `null` to be `true`, meaning bookings could be created (in early development) without a username. This was done so I could implement the booking system without encountering errors. By removing those two fields and migrating the changes to the database, the 'my-bookings' page correctly displayed bookings relevant to the signed-in user. |
| ![testing screenshot](docs/testing/mob_nav_not_appearing.png) | Mobile nav toggle not rendering after adding login status message in header. | ![testing screenshot](docs/testing/mob_nav_not_appearing2.png) Fixed stylings in CSS. (Nav toggle was later centered) |
| ![testing screenshot](docs/testing/expired_function_not_working_1.png) [testing screenshot](docs/testing/expired_function_not_working_2.png) | [testing screenshot](docs/testing/expired_function_working_1.png) [testing screenshot](docs/testing/expired_function_working_2.png) Another common issue I encountered was the expired function not working. All bookings were marked as active, despite being expired. | The function was not correctly calculating the end time for each booking, as so wasn't being flagged as expired as there was no `end_time` to compare to. I fixed this by changing `end_time` to `time`.|
| ![testing screenshot](docs/testing/edit_booking_not_working_1.png) | Edit booking button not working correctly. | ![testing screenshot](docs/testing/edit_booking_working.png) A simple replacement of the urls from `booking.html` to `my-bookings`. |
